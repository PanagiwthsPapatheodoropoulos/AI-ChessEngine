A Java-based AI chess engine developed by [Panagiwths Papatheodoropoulos](https://github.com/PanagiwthsPapatheodoropoulos). This project aims to provide an intelligent opponent for chess games, utilizing established algorithms to evaluate and determine optimal moves.

## Features

- **Language:** Java
- **AI Algorithms:** Implements Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for efficient move evaluation.
- **Game Modes:** Play against the AI or observe AI vs. AI matches.
- **Board Representation:** Utilizes standard chess notation and board representation for move calculations.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- An IDE or text editor for Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
